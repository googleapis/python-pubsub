    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Required. The name of the subscription. It must have the
            format
            ``"projects/{project}/subscriptions/{subscription}"``.
            ``{subscription}`` must start with a letter, and contain

            (``-``), underscores (``_``), periods (``.``), tildes
            (``~``), plus (``+``) or percent signs (``%``). It must be
            between 3 and 255 characters in length, and it must not
            start with ``"goog"``.
        topic (str):
            Required. The name of the topic from which this subscription
            is receiving messages. Format is
            ``projects/{project}/topics/{topic}``. The value of this
            field will be ``_deleted-topic_`` if the topic has been
            deleted.
        push_config (google.pubsub_v1.types.PushConfig):
            Optional. If push delivery is used with this
            subscription, this field is used to configure
            it.
        bigquery_config (google.pubsub_v1.types.BigQueryConfig):
            Optional. If delivery to BigQuery is used
            with this subscription, this field is used to
            configure it.
        cloud_storage_config (google.pubsub_v1.types.CloudStorageConfig):
            Optional. If delivery to Google Cloud Storage
            is used with this subscription, this field is
            used to configure it.
        ack_deadline_seconds (int):
            Optional. The approximate amount of time (on a best-effort
            basis) Pub/Sub waits for the subscriber to acknowledge
            receipt before resending the message. In the interval after
            the message is delivered and before it is acknowledged, it
            is considered to be *outstanding*. During that time period,
            the message will not be redelivered (on a best-effort
            basis).

            For pull subscriptions, this value is used as the initial
            value for the ack deadline. To override this value for a
            given message, call ``ModifyAckDeadline`` with the
            corresponding ``ack_id`` if using non-streaming pull or send
            the ``ack_id`` in a ``StreamingModifyAckDeadlineRequest`` if
            using streaming pull. The minimum custom deadline you can
            specify is 10 seconds. The maximum custom deadline you can
            specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes). If this parameter is 0,
            a default value of 10 seconds is used.

            For push delivery, this value is also used to set the
            request timeout for the call to the push endpoint.

            If the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the
            Pub/Sub system will eventually redeliver the message.
        retain_acked_messages (bool):
            Optional. Indicates whether to retain acknowledged messages.
            If true, then messages are not expunged from the
            subscription's backlog, even if they are acknowledged, until
            they fall out of the ``message_retention_duration`` window.
            This must be true if you would like to [``Seek`` to a
            timestamp]
            (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview#seek_to_a_time)
            in the past to replay previously-acknowledged messages.
        message_retention_duration (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
            Optional. How long to retain unacknowledged messages in the
            subscription's backlog, from the moment a message is
            published. If ``retain_acked_messages`` is true, then this
            also configures the retention of acknowledged messages, and
            thus configures how far back in time a ``Seek`` can be done.
            Defaults to 7 days. Cannot be more than 31 days or less than
            10 minutes.
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Optional. See `Creating and managing
            labels <https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/labels>`__.
        enable_message_ordering (bool):
            Optional. If true, messages published with the same
            ``ordering_key`` in ``PubsubMessage`` will be delivered to
            the subscribers in the order in which they are received by
            the Pub/Sub system. Otherwise, they may be delivered in any
            order.
        expiration_policy (google.pubsub_v1.types.ExpirationPolicy):
            Optional. A policy that specifies the conditions for this
            subscription's expiration. A subscription is considered
            active as long as any connected subscriber is successfully
            consuming messages from the subscription or is issuing
            operations on the subscription. If ``expiration_policy`` is
            not set, a *default policy* with ``ttl`` of 31 days will be
            used. The minimum allowed value for
            ``expiration_policy.ttl`` is 1 day. If ``expiration_policy``
            is set, but ``expiration_policy.ttl`` is not set, the
            subscription never expires.
        filter (str):
            Optional. An expression written in the Pub/Sub `filter
            language <https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/filtering>`__.
            If non-empty, then only ``PubsubMessage``\ s whose
            ``attributes`` field matches the filter are delivered on
            this subscription. If empty, then no messages are filtered
            out.
        dead_letter_policy (google.pubsub_v1.types.DeadLetterPolicy):
            Optional. A policy that specifies the conditions for dead
            lettering messages in this subscription. If
            dead_letter_policy is not set, dead lettering is disabled.

            The Pub/Sub service account associated with this
            subscriptions's parent project (i.e.,
            service-{project_number}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com)
            must have permission to Acknowledge() messages on this
            subscription.
        retry_policy (google.pubsub_v1.types.RetryPolicy):
            Optional. A policy that specifies how Pub/Sub
            retries message delivery for this subscription.

            If not set, the default retry policy is applied.
            This generally implies that messages will be
            retried as soon as possible for healthy
            subscribers. RetryPolicy will be triggered on
            NACKs or acknowledgement deadline exceeded
            events for a given message.
        detached (bool):
            Optional. Indicates whether the subscription is detached
            from its topic. Detached subscriptions don't receive
            messages from their topic and don't retain any backlog.
            ``Pull`` and ``StreamingPull`` requests will return
            FAILED_PRECONDITION. If the subscription is a push
            subscription, pushes to the endpoint will not be made.
        enable_exactly_once_delivery (bool):
            Optional. If true, Pub/Sub provides the following guarantees
            for the delivery of a message with a given value of
            ``message_id`` on this subscription:

            -  The message sent to a subscriber is guaranteed not to be
               resent before the message's acknowledgement deadline
               expires.
            -  An acknowledged message will not be resent to a
               subscriber.

            Note that subscribers may still receive multiple copies of a
            message when ``enable_exactly_once_delivery`` is true if the
            message was published multiple times by a publisher client.
            These copies are considered distinct by Pub/Sub and have
            distinct ``message_id`` values.
        topic_message_retention_duration (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
            Output only. Indicates the minimum duration for which a
            message is retained after it is published to the
            subscription's topic. If this field is set, messages
            published to the subscription's topic in the last
            ``topic_message_retention_duration`` are always available to
            subscribers. See the ``message_retention_duration`` field in
            ``Topic``. This field is set only in responses from the
            server; it is ignored if it is set in any requests.
        state (google.pubsub_v1.types.Subscription.State):
            Output only. An output-only field indicating
            whether or not the subscription can receive
            messages.
        analytics_hub_subscription_info (google.pubsub_v1.types.Subscription.AnalyticsHubSubscriptionInfo):
            Output only. Information about the associated

            subscritpion is created by Analytics Hub.

            Optional. Transforms to be applied to

            will always return a valid version, even if the subscription
            was created without this attribute.

            reconnects for the same stream, the client_id should be set

            stream can be transferred to the new stream. The same
            client_id should not be used for different client instances.
        max_outstanding_messages (int):

            pull client that have not yet been acked or nacked, the
