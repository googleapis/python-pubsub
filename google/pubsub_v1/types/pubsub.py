            For pull subscriptions, this value is used as the initial
            value for the ack deadline. To override this value for a
            given message, call ``ModifyAckDeadline`` with the
            corresponding ``ack_id`` if using non-streaming pull or send
            the ``ack_id`` in a ``StreamingModifyAckDeadlineRequest`` if
            using streaming pull. The minimum custom deadline you can
            specify is 10 seconds. The maximum custom deadline you can
            specify is 600 seconds (10 minutes). If this parameter is 0,
            a default value of 10 seconds is used.

            For push delivery, this value is also used to set the
            request timeout for the call to the push endpoint.

            If the subscriber never acknowledges the message, the
            Pub/Sub system will eventually redeliver the message.
        retain_acked_messages (bool):
            Indicates whether to retain acknowledged messages. If true,
            then messages are not expunged from the subscription's
            backlog, even if they are acknowledged, until they fall out
            of the ``message_retention_duration`` window. This must be
            true if you would like to [``Seek`` to a timestamp]
            (https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview#seek_to_a_time)
            in the past to replay previously-acknowledged messages.
        message_retention_duration (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
            How long to retain unacknowledged messages in the
            subscription's backlog, from the moment a message is
            published. If ``retain_acked_messages`` is true, then this
            also configures the retention of acknowledged messages, and
            thus configures how far back in time a ``Seek`` can be done.
            Defaults to 7 days. Cannot be more than 7 days or less than
            10 minutes.
        labels (Mapping[str, str]):
            See <a
            href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/labels">
            Creating and managing labels</a>.
        enable_message_ordering (bool):
            If true, messages published with the same ``ordering_key``
            in ``PubsubMessage`` will be delivered to the subscribers in
            the order in which they are received by the Pub/Sub system.
            Otherwise, they may be delivered in any order.
        expiration_policy (google.pubsub_v1.types.ExpirationPolicy):
            A policy that specifies the conditions for this
            subscription's expiration. A subscription is considered
            active as long as any connected subscriber is successfully
            consuming messages from the subscription or is issuing
            operations on the subscription. If ``expiration_policy`` is
            not set, a *default policy* with ``ttl`` of 31 days will be
            used. The minimum allowed value for
            ``expiration_policy.ttl`` is 1 day.
        filter (str):
            An expression written in the Pub/Sub `filter
            language <https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/filtering>`__.
            If non-empty, then only ``PubsubMessage``\ s whose
            ``attributes`` field matches the filter are delivered on
            this subscription. If empty, then no messages are filtered
            out.
        dead_letter_policy (google.pubsub_v1.types.DeadLetterPolicy):
            A policy that specifies the conditions for dead lettering
            messages in this subscription. If dead_letter_policy is not
            set, dead lettering is disabled.

            The Cloud Pub/Sub service account associated with this
            subscriptions's parent project (i.e.,
            service-{project_number}@gcp-sa-pubsub.iam.gserviceaccount.com)
            must have permission to Acknowledge() messages on this
            subscription.
        retry_policy (google.pubsub_v1.types.RetryPolicy):
            A policy that specifies how Pub/Sub retries
            message delivery for this subscription.

            If not set, the default retry policy is applied.
            This generally implies that messages will be
            retried as soon as possible for healthy
            subscribers. RetryPolicy will be triggered on
            NACKs or acknowledgement deadline exceeded
            events for a given message.
        detached (bool):
            Indicates whether the subscription is detached from its
            topic. Detached subscriptions don't receive messages from
            their topic and don't retain any backlog. ``Pull`` and
            ``StreamingPull`` requests will return FAILED_PRECONDITION.
            If the subscription is a push subscription, pushes to the
            endpoint will not be made.
        enable_exactly_once_delivery (bool):
            If true, Pub/Sub provides the following guarantees for the
            delivery of a message with a given value of ``message_id``
            on this subscription:

            -  The message sent to a subscriber is guaranteed not to be
               resent before the message's acknowledgement deadline
               expires.
            -  An acknowledged message will not be resent to a
               subscriber.

            Note that subscribers may still receive multiple copies of a
            message when ``enable_exactly_once_delivery`` is true if the
            message was published multiple times by a publisher client.
            These copies are considered distinct by Pub/Sub and have
            distinct ``message_id`` values.
        topic_message_retention_duration (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration):
            Output only. Indicates the minimum duration for which a
            message is retained after it is published to the
            subscription's topic. If this field is set, messages
            published to the subscription's topic in the last
            ``topic_message_retention_duration`` are always available to
            subscribers. See the ``message_retention_duration`` field in
            ``Topic``. This field is set only in responses from the
            server; it is ignored if it is set in any requests.
        state (google.pubsub_v1.types.Subscription.State):

        attributes (Mapping[str, str]):

            control different aspects of the message delivery.

            The only currently supported attribute is
            ``x-goog-version``, which you can use to change the format
            of the pushed message. This attribute indicates the version
            of the data expected by the endpoint. This controls the
            shape of the pushed message (i.e., its fields and metadata).

            If not present during the ``CreateSubscription`` call, it
            will default to the version of the Pub/Sub API used to make
            such call. If not present in a ``ModifyPushConfig`` call,

            will always return a valid version, even if the subscription
            was created without this attribute.

            The only supported values for the ``x-goog-version``
            attribute are:

            -  ``v1beta1``: uses the push format defined in the v1beta1

            for the same stream, the client_id should be set to the same
            value so that state associated with the old stream can be
            transferred to the new stream. The same client_id should not
            be used for different client instances.
        max_outstanding_messages (int):
            Flow control settings for the maximum number of outstanding
            messages. When there are ``max_outstanding_messages`` or
            more currently sent to the streaming pull client that have
            not yet been acked or nacked, the server stops sending more
            messages. The sending of messages resumes once the number of
            outstanding messages is less than this value. If the value
            is <= 0, there is no limit to the number of outstanding
            messages. This property can only be set on the initial

            worth of messages currently sent to the streaming pull
            client that have not yet been acked or nacked, the server
            will stop sending more messages. The sending of messages

    r"""A snapshot resource. Snapshots are used in
    `Seek <https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview>`__
    operations, which allow you to manage message acknowledgments in
    bulk. That is, you can set the acknowledgment state of messages in
    an existing subscription to the state captured by a snapshot.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            The name of the snapshot.
        topic (str):
            The name of the topic from which this
            snapshot is retaining messages.
        expire_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            The snapshot is guaranteed to exist up until this time. A
            newly-created snapshot expires no later than 7 days from the
            time of its creation. Its exact lifetime is determined at
            creation by the existing backlog in the source subscription.
            Specifically, the lifetime of the snapshot is
            ``7 days - (age of oldest unacked message in the subscription)``.
            For example, consider a subscription whose oldest unacked
            message is 3 days old. If a snapshot is created from this
            subscription, the snapshot -- which will always capture this
            3-day-old backlog as long as the snapshot exists -- will
            expire in 4 days. The service will refuse to create a
            snapshot that would expire in less than 1 hour after
            creation.
