class Batch(base.Batch):
    """A batch of messages.

    The batch is the internal group of messages which are either awaiting
    publication or currently in progress.

    A batch is automatically created by the PublisherClient when the first
    message to be published is received; subsequent messages are added to
    that batch until the process of actual publishing _starts_.

    Once this occurs, any new messages sent to :meth:`publish` open a new
    batch.

    If you are using this library, you most likely do not need to instantiate
    batch objects directly; they will be created for you. If you want to
    change the actual batching settings, see the ``batching`` argument on
    :class:`~.pubsub_v1.PublisherClient`.

    Any properties or methods on this class which are not defined in
    :class:`~.pubsub_v1.publisher.batch.BaseBatch` should be considered
    implementation details.

    Args:
        client:
            The publisher client used to create this batch.
        topic:
            The topic. The format for this is ``projects/{project}/topics/{topic}``.
        settings:
            The settings for batch publishing. These should be considered immutable
            once the batch has been opened.
        batch_done_callback:
            Callback called when the response for a batch publish has been received.
            Called with one boolean argument: successfully published or a permanent
            error occurred. Temporary errors are not surfaced because they are retried
            at a lower level.
        commit_when_full:
            Whether to commit the batch when the batch is full.
        commit_retry:
            Designation of what errors, if any, should be retried when commiting
            the batch. If not provided, a default retry is used.
        commit_timeout:
            The timeout to apply when commiting the batch. If not provided, a default
            timeout is used.
