    This creates an object that is capable of publishing messages.
    Generally, you can instantiate this client with no arguments, and you
    get sensible defaults.

    Args:
        batch_settings:
            The settings for batch publishing.
        publisher_options:
            The options for the publisher client. Note that enabling message ordering
            will override the publish retry timeout to be infinite.
        kwargs:
            Any additional arguments provided are sent as keyword arguments to the
            underlying
            :class:`~google.cloud.pubsub_v1.gapic.publisher_client.PublisherClient`.
            Generally you should not need to set additional keyword
            arguments. Regional endpoints can be set via ``client_options`` that
            takes a single key-value pair that defines the endpoint.

        .. note::
            Messages in Pub/Sub are blobs of bytes. They are *binary* data,
            not text. You must send data as a bytestring
            (``bytes`` in Python 3; ``str`` in Python 2), and this library
            will raise an exception if you send a text string.

            The reason that this is so important (and why we do not try to
            coerce for you) is because Pub/Sub is also platform independent
            and there is no way to know how to decode messages properly on
            the other side; therefore, encoding and decoding is a required
            exercise for the developer.

        Add the given message to this object; this will cause it to be
        published once the batch either has enough messages or a sufficient
        period of time has elapsed.
        This method may block if LimitExceededBehavior.BLOCK is used in the
        flow control settings.

        Example:
            >>> from google.cloud import pubsub_v1
            >>> client = pubsub_v1.PublisherClient()
            >>> topic = client.topic_path('[PROJECT]', '[TOPIC]')
            >>> data = b'The rain in Wales falls mainly on the snails.'
            >>> response = client.publish(topic, data, username='guido')

        Args:
            topic: The topic to publish messages to.
            data: A bytestring representing the message body. This
                must be a bytestring.
            ordering_key: A string that identifies related messages for which
                publish order should be respected. Message ordering must be
                enabled for this client to use this feature.
            retry:
                Designation of what errors, if any, should be retried. If `ordering_key`
                is specified, the total retry deadline will be changed to "infinity".
                If given, it overides any retry passed into the client through
                the ``publisher_options`` argument.
            timeout:
                The timeout for the RPC request. Can be used to override any timeout
                passed in through ``publisher_options`` when instantiating the client.

            attrs: A dictionary of attributes to be
                sent as metadata. (These may be text strings or byte strings.)

            :class:`~concurrent.futures.Future` interface (but not an
            instance of that class).

        Raises:
